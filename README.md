# i-forgot-to-record-my-piano
An application in Python that runs in the background and records MIDI input at all times. If you play something on your piano and forgot to record it, this app captures MIDI files (max. 5 min per file) so you will never lose your ideas, even if you forgot to record them. Press C2 3 times consecutively (note 36) to open the logs and also force save.
